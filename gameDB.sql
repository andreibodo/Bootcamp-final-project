(948, 345, 'The Orange Box', '<p>This is one of the most original events in the gaming industry - the simultaneous release of five AAA class games by Valve within one set.</p>\n<p>The Orange Box is one “box” that was sold for the price of one full-fledged release of the AAA game, but included not one game, but five:</p>\n<p>Half-Life 2,<br />\nHalf-Life 2 Supplement: Episode One,<br />\nHalf-Life 2 Supplement: Episode Two,<br />\nPortal,<br />\nTeam fortress 2</p>\n<h3>The situation around the release of The Orange Box</h3>\n<p>The appearance of The Orange Box had several reasons. The development of three games at Valve went in parallel and ended almost simultaneously. At the same time, the games industry has matured to redefine the relationship between game manufacturers and game sellers. In particular, the sellers did not want to trade additions to games.</p>\n<h3>Valve Solution</h3>\n<p>By this time, Valve had already had problems distributing Half-Life 2: Episode One and decided to release Half-Life 2: Episode Two in the same set with other games for the price of one big release.</p>\n<p>As a result, not only Half-Life 2: Episode Two, but also games that were completely atypical for the market at that time: good multiplayer game Team Fortress 2 and a small indie game Portal, made good progress on the market.</p>\n<p>The release of The Orange Box also solved the main problem of the game Portal. This game was so different from everything in the world of games that the producers didn’t really know exactly how to explain to people what this game was good for.</p>\n<p>As part of the set, the game somehow fell into the hands of many people, they tried to play it, and later recognized its original features as its strengths and not its shortcomings. In particular, such a find as GLaDOS received great approval.</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2 and its predecessors</h3>\n<p>This game is a sequel to Half-Life, released six years after the first game.</p>\n<p>The first Half-Life has opened a new stage in the video game industry, especially in the shooter genre. Its innovations include:<br />\n- the development of the plot completely inside the playing space without using video,<br />\n- high artificial intelligence of opponents,<br />\n- the hero has allies,<br />\n- A new level of player interaction with the environment, as well as the constant need for such interaction for progress in the game. A lot of puzzles are also built on this interaction.</p>\n<p>The game is not divided into levels or missions. The player sees only through the eyes of the main character - Gordon Freeman. The hero can not be seen from the side, you can not hear his voice - this is done to fully immerse the player in the game.</p>\n<p>The arsenal of weapons in Half-Life is a combination of human (including powerful experimental) and alien weapons.</p>\n<p>In addition to 14 types of weapons that the hero can carry with him, occasionally there are stationary weapons, which can also be used. There are also grenades and booby traps.</p>\n<p>The action of the first half-life takes place in the underground Black Mesa Research Facility. They are experimenting with the so-called “Anomalous Material” - a crystal, the error in working with which opens a portal to another dimension, from which hostile aliens invade Earth.</p>\n<p>The hero, Gordon Freeman, worked as a researcher at this place, and after the disaster he tries to get out of the complex, penetrate the alien dimension and destroy the leader of a hostile alien civilization, Nihilanth, to close the portal and stop the alien invasion. In the final of the first game Gordon succeeds.</p>\n<p>There are three additions to the original Half-Life:<br />\n- Half-Life: Opposing Force (1999),<br />\n- Half-Life: Blue Shift (2001),<br />\n- Half-Life: Decay (2001).</p>\n<p>The events of the main plot and official additions occur simultaneously, as a result of which the paths of the characters can intersect, and the events can affect both the one addition and the others.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you have to play is not a character of Gordon, and you can see Gordon from the side.</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2</h3>\n<p>continues the story about twenty years after the incident at Black Mesa, in one of the largest cities on Earth, located somewhere in Eastern Europe - City 17.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, Gordon Freeman finds himself on a train arriving in City 17, unarmed and without his protective suit. City 17 is ruled by a totalitarian government headed by Wallace Breen, former administrator of the Black Mesa research center. After the events of the first game, the power of aliens has been established all over the Earth - aliens rule through people who have passed to their side. Wallace Breen - the head of these traitors and the main agent of enemies.</p>\n<p>Half-Life 2 has become an even more noticeable breakthrough for the video game industry. The main technological advances of Half-Life 2 are:<br />\n- the new engine, which raised the level of character animation,<br />\n- even more powerful artificial intelligence of opponents,<br />\n- realistic physics of the game world,<br />\n- even more intense interaction of the player with the environment,</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2: Episode One</h3>\n<p>This is a continuation of the plot of Half-Life 2 and the first part of the trilogy of episodes - the sequels of Half-Life 2.</p>\n<p>For much of Episode One, the player interacts with the computer character Alyx Vance. The plot of the episode continues the story of Half-Life and Half-Life 2, and begins from the moment at which the previous game ended.</p>\n<p>Episode One is significantly shorter than Half-Life 2, all the action takes place in the City 17.</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2: Episode Two</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>the second part in the trilogy of episodes, continuing the plot of the computer game Half-Life 2.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The creators of the game try to base each episode on a specific theme. As part of this strategy, Episode Two focuses on open spaces, long journeys (even by car) and less linear gameplay than in previous games in the Half-Life series. Locations include abandoned mines, ant-lion&#39;s nest and missile base.</p>\n<p>The game develops immediately after the events of Episode One in a wooded area near the destroyed City 17.</p>\n<p>Alyx Vance is present in the game, but less active than in the previous episode</p>\n<p>Each following addition is noticeably more perfect technically. This is part of the game manufacturer&#39;s strategy, which thus solved the problem of a gradual development of the game and the absence of long waiting periods for consumers.</p>\n<h3>Portal</h3>\n<p>The events of the game Portal take place in the Half-Life universe, in the Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center. The heroine is a girl named Chell.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is based on solving puzzles using a portable device Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. This device allows you to create portals on flat surfaces through which you can instantly move yourself or objects in space.</p>\n<p>At the same time, only two portals can be opened, differing in color - blue and orange. When you open a new portal, the previously opened portal of the same color closes. In addition, portals of the same color can open on top of each other, while the portal “opposite” in color should be opened to the side.</p>\n<p>As the game progresses, tasks become more difficult, and to solve it is necessary to combine various techniques. Obstacles also arise: walls on which it is impossible to create a portal, energy fields. Passing through such fields destroys the items that the player carries, and also closes the open portals, leaving only the device for creating them.</p>\n<h3>GLaDOS</h3>\n<p>An essential part of the game is the GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence and self-awareness supercomputer that was developed for the Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center, but went out of control and captured the Enrichment Center.</p>\n<p>GLaDOS is an abbreviation for &quot;Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System&quot;. GLaDOS is a female character.</p>\n<p>In the game Portal GLaDOS is both the enemy of the player and his guide to the Enrichment Center. GLaDOS observes and controls the passage of tests, gives instructions on the use of objects of the Enrichment Center, sometimes gives advice and cautions. The voice of GLaDOS accompanies the player throughout the game, but until the very end it is unknown who or what GLaDOS is and what role it plays in Aperture Science.</p>\n<h3>Team fortress 2</h3>\n<p>Team Fortress was originally created as a modification for the Quake game. The success of this game led to the development of Team Fortress 2 - a game separate from Quake. The game with this name appeared after many years of work. The game had its own visual style and plot, full of hidden and explicit meanings. By genre, the game Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer team shooter.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The world of Team Fortress 2 is the arena where the organizations RED and BLU, created by the Mann brothers, Blutarch and Redmond, secretly confront. The brothers competed for the land of the father.</p>\n<p>RED - short for Reliable Excavation &amp; Demolition. RED builds reservoirs, mines, produces bread and beer. The buildings of RED and its equipment are painted in red and yellow, the main building materials are wood, red brick and dark red metal sheets.</p>\n<p>BLU is short for Builders League United. The company builds hydroelectric power plants, owns dairy farms. Buildings BLU are made in blue and white colors of white brick and metal.</p>\n<p>RED and BLU are waging an irreconcilable struggle, which takes various forms - from unfair competition in business to armed clashes between specially hired mercenaries.</p>\n<p>Clashes take the form of seizing and holding control of territory, seizing important heights, destroying enemy bases and industrial espionage.</p>\n<p>Clashes between companies take place at various industrial sites, such as mines, reservoirs, quarries and power plants. The secret bases of corporations, computer centers and rocket bunkers under the guise of such organizations are often hidden.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game takes place on separate territories, called game maps. Each map refers to one of several game modes.</p>\n<p>Two teams take part in the game, which differ in the color of the form - Red and Blue - these are mercenaries of two opposing companies.</p>\n<p>Teams consist of characters that can be live players or bots. Each class of characters has weapons in their arsenal, allowing them to attack opponents from the other team, and other things designed for different purposes.</p>\n<h3>Game modes</h3>\n<p>Game mode defines the tasks of each team on the map.</p>\n<p>Capture The Flag<br />\nCapture the files<br />\nControl Points (in two versions: Symmetric Control Point and Attack / Defense)<br />\nTerritory control<br />\nPayload<br />\nArena<br />\nPayload race<br />\nKing of the hill<br />\nSpecial Delivery<br />\nMann vs. Machine<br />\nRobot Destroy<br />\nPass time</p>\n<p>The game has several classes of playing characters, quite different from each other. In numerous additions to the game there are changes and additions for the game modes, and for individual classes of characters.</p>', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f5/4f5ba4c03c5aea5d15b3067f894431cc.jpg', '2008-01-01'),

The development of three games at Valve went in parallel and ended almost simultaneously. At the same time, the games industry has matured to redefine the relationship between game manufacturers and game sellers. In particular, the sellers did not want to trade additions to games.</p>\n<h3>Valve Solution</h3>\n<p>By this time, Valve had already had problems distributing Half-Life 2: Episode One and decided to release Half-Life 2: Episode Two in the same set with other games for the price of one big release.</p>\n<p>As a result, not only Half-Life 2: Episode Two, but also games that were completely atypical for the market at that time: good multiplayer game Team Fortress 2 and a small indie game Portal, made good progress on the market.</p>\n<p>The release of The Orange Box also solved the main problem of the game Portal. This game was so different from everything in the world of games that the producers didn’t really know exactly how to explain to people what this game was good for.</p>\n<p>As part of the set, the game somehow fell into the hands of many people, they tried to play it, and later recognized its original features as its strengths and not its shortcomings. In particular, such a find as GLaDOS received great approval.</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2 and its predecessors</h3>\n<p>This game is a sequel to Half-Life, released six years after the first game.</p>\n<p>The first Half-Life has opened a new stage in the video game industry, especially in the shooter genre. Its innovations include:<br />\n- the development of the plot completely inside the playing space without using video,<br />\n- high artificial intelligence of opponents,<br />\n- the hero has allies,<br />\n- A new level of player interaction with the environment, as well as the constant need for such interaction for progress in the game. A lot of puzzles are also built on this interaction.</p>\n<p>The game is not divided into levels or missions. The player sees only through the eyes of the main character - Gordon Freeman. The hero can not be seen from the side, you can not hear his voice - this is done to fully immerse the player in the game.</p>\n<p>The arsenal of weapons in Half-Life is a combination of human (including powerful experimental) and alien weapons.</p>\n<p>In addition to 14 types of weapons that the hero can carry with him, occasionally there are stationary weapons, which can also be used. There are also grenades and booby traps.</p>\n<p>The action of the first half-life takes place in the underground Black Mesa Research Facility. They are experimenting with the so-called “Anomalous Material” - a crystal, the error in working with which opens a portal to another dimension, from which hostile aliens invade Earth.</p>\n<p>The hero, Gordon Freeman, worked as a researcher at this place, and after the disaster he tries to get out of the complex, penetrate the alien dimension and destroy the leader of a hostile alien civilization, Nihilanth, to close the portal and stop the alien invasion. In the final of the first game Gordon succeeds.</p>\n<p>There are three additions to the original Half-Life:<br />\n- Half-Life: Opposing Force (1999),<br />\n- Half-Life: Blue Shift (2001),<br />\n- Half-Life: Decay (2001).</p>\n<p>The events of the main plot and official additions occur simultaneously, as a result of which the paths of the characters can intersect, and the events can affect both the one addition and the others.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you have to play is not a character of Gordon, and you can see Gordon from the side.</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2</h3>\n<p>continues the story about twenty years after the incident at Black Mesa, in one of the largest cities on Earth, located somewhere in Eastern Europe - City 17.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, Gordon Freeman finds himself on a train arriving in City 17, unarmed and without his protective suit. City 17 is ruled by a totalitarian government headed by Wallace Breen, former administrator of the Black Mesa research center. After the events of the first game, the power of aliens has been established all over the Earth - aliens rule through people who have passed to their side. Wallace Breen - the head of these traitors and the main agent of enemies.</p>\n<p>Half-Life 2 has become an even more noticeable breakthrough for the video game industry.

This game was so different from everything in the world of games that the producers didn’t really know exactly how to explain to people what this game was good for.</p>\n<p>As part of the set, the game somehow fell into the hands of many people, they tried to play it, and later recognized its original features as its strengths and not its shortcomings. In particular, such a find as GLaDOS received great approval.</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2 and its predecessors</h3>\n<p>This game is a sequel to Half-Life, released six years after the first game.</p>\n<p>The first Half-Life has opened a new stage in the video game industry, especially in the shooter genre. Its innovations include:<br />\n- the development of the plot completely inside the playing space without using video,<br />\n- high artificial intelligence of opponents,<br />\n- the hero has allies,<br />\n- A new level of player interaction with the environment, as well as the constant need for such interaction for progress in the game. A lot of puzzles are also built on this interaction.</p>\n<p>The game is not divided into levels or missions. The player sees only through the eyes of the main character - Gordon Freeman. The hero can not be seen from the side, you can not hear his voice - this is done to fully immerse the player in the game.</p>\n<p>The arsenal of weapons in Half-Life is a combination of human (including powerful experimental) and alien weapons.</p>\n<p>In addition to 14 types of weapons that the hero can carry with him, occasionally there are stationary weapons, which can also be used. There are also grenades and booby traps.</p>\n<p>The action of the first half-life takes place in the underground Black Mesa Research Facility. They are experimenting with the so-called “Anomalous Material” - a crystal, the error in working with which opens a portal to another dimension, from which hostile aliens invade Earth.</p>\n<p>The hero, Gordon Freeman, worked as a researcher at this place, and after the disaster he tries to get out of the complex, penetrate the alien dimension and destroy the leader of a hostile alien civilization, Nihilanth, to close the portal and stop the alien invasion. In the final of the first game Gordon succeeds.</p>\n<p>There are three additions to the original Half-Life:<br />\n- Half-Life: Opposing Force (1999),<br />\n- Half-Life: Blue Shift (2001),<br />\n- Half-Life: Decay (2001).</p>\n<p>The events of the main plot and official additions occur simultaneously, as a result of which the paths of the characters can intersect, and the events can affect both the one addition and the others.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you have to play is not a character of Gordon, and you can see Gordon from the side.</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2</h3>\n<p>continues the story about twenty years after the incident at Black Mesa, in one of the largest cities on Earth, located somewhere in Eastern Europe - City 17.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, Gordon Freeman finds himself on a train arriving in City 17, unarmed and without his protective suit. City 17 is ruled by a totalitarian government headed by Wallace Breen, former administrator of the Black Mesa research center. After the events of the first game, the power of aliens has been established all over the Earth - aliens rule through people who have passed to their side. Wallace Breen - the head of these traitors and the main agent of enemies.</p>\n<p>Half-Life 2 has become an even more noticeable breakthrough for the video game industry. The main technological advances of Half-Life 2 are:<br />\n- the new engine, which raised the level of character animation,<br />\n- even more powerful artificial intelligence of opponents,<br />\n- realistic physics of the game world,<br />\n- even more intense interaction of the player with the environment,</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2: Episode One</h3>\n<p>This is a continuation of the plot of Half-Life 2 and the first part of the trilogy of episodes - the sequels of Half-Life 2.</p>\n<p>For much of Episode One, the player interacts with the computer character Alyx Vance. The plot of the episode continues the story of Half-Life and Half-Life 2, and begins from the moment at which the previous game ended.</p>\n<p>Episode One is significantly shorter than Half-Life 2, all the action takes place in the City 17.</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2: Episode Two</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>the second part in the trilogy of episodes, continuing the plot of the computer game Half-Life 2.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The creators of the game try to base each episode on a specific theme. As part of this strategy, Episode Two focuses on open spaces, long journeys (even by car) and less linear gameplay than in previous games in the Half-Life series. Locations include abandoned mines, ant-lion&#39;s nest and missile base.</p>\n<p>The game develops immediately after the events of Episode One in a wooded area near the destroyed City 17.</p>\n<p>Alyx Vance is present in the game, but less active than in the previous episode</p>\n<p>Each following addition is noticeably more perfect technically. This is part of the game manufacturer&#39;s strategy, which thus solved the problem of a gradual development of the game and the absence of long waiting periods for consumers.</p>\n<h3>Portal</h3>\n<p>The events of the game Portal take place in the Half-Life universe, in the Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center. The heroine is a girl named Chell.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is based on solving puzzles using a portable device Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. This device allows you to create portals on flat surfaces through which you can instantly move yourself or objects in space.</p>\n<p>At the same time, only two portals can be opened, differing in color - blue and orange. When you open a new portal, the previously opened portal of the same color closes. In addition, portals of the same color can open on top of each other, while the portal “opposite” in color should be opened to the side.</p>\n<p>As the game progresses, tasks become more difficult, and to solve it is necessary to combine various techniques. Obstacles also arise: walls on which it is impossible to create a portal, energy fields. Passing through such fields destroys the items that the player carries, and also closes the open portals, leaving only the device for creating them.</p>\n<h3>GLaDOS</h3>\n<p>An essential part of the game is the GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence and self-awareness supercomputer that was developed for the Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center, but went out of control and captured the Enrichment Center.</p>\n<p>GLaDOS is an abbreviation for &quot;Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System&quot;. GLaDOS is a female character.</p>\n<p>In the game Portal GLaDOS is both the enemy of the player and his guide to the Enrichment Center. GLaDOS observes and controls the passage of tests, gives instructions on the use of objects of the Enrichment Center, sometimes gives advice and cautions. The voice of GLaDOS accompanies the player throughout the game, but until the very end it is unknown who or what GLaDOS is and what role it plays in Aperture Science.</p>\n<h3>Team fortress 2</h3>\n<p>Team Fortress was originally created as a modification for the Quake game. The success of this game led to the development of Team Fortress 2 - a game separate from Quake. The game with this name appeared after many years of work. The game had its own visual style and plot, full of hidden and explicit meanings. By genre, the game Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer team shooter.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The world of Team Fortress 2 is the arena where the organizations RED and BLU, created by the Mann brothers, Blutarch and Redmond, secretly confront. The brothers competed for the land of the father.</p>\n<p>RED - short for Reliable Excavation &amp; Demolition. RED builds reservoirs, mines, produces bread and beer. The buildings of RED and its equipment are painted in red and yellow, the main building materials are wood, red brick and dark red metal sheets.</p>\n<p>BLU is short for Builders League United. The company builds hydroelectric power plants, owns dairy farms. Buildings BLU are made in blue and white colors of white brick and metal.</p>\n<p>RED and BLU are waging an irreconcilable struggle, which takes various forms - from unfair competition in business to armed clashes between specially hired mercenaries.</p>\n<p>Clashes take the form of seizing and holding control of territory, seizing important heights, destroying enemy bases and industrial espionage.</p>\n<p>Clashes between companies take place at various industrial sites, such as mines, reservoirs, quarries and power plants. The secret bases of corporations, computer centers and rocket bunkers under the guise of such organizations are often hidden.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game takes place on separate territories, called game maps. Each map refers to one of several game modes.</p>\n<p>Two teams take part in the game, which differ in the color of the form - Red and Blue - these are mercenaries of two opposing companies.</p>\n<p>Teams consist of characters that can be live players or bots. Each class of characters has weapons in their arsenal, allowing them to attack opponents from the other team, and other things designed for different purposes.</p>\n<h3>Game modes</h3>\n<p>Game mode defines the tasks of each team on the map.</p>\n<p>Capture The Flag<br />\nCapture the files<br />\nControl Points (in two versions: Symmetric Control Point and Attack / Defense)<br />\nTerritory control<br />\nPayload<br />\nArena<br />\nPayload race<br />\nKing of the hill<br />\nSpecial Delivery<br />\nMann vs. Machine<br />\nRobot Destroy<br />\nPass time</p>\n<p>The game has several classes of playing characters, quite different from each other. In numerous additions to the game there are changes and additions for the game modes, and for individual classes of characters.</p>', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/4f5/4f5ba4c03c5aea5d15b3067f894431cc.jpg', '2008-01-01'),

(1025, 379, 'The Orange Box', '<p>This is one of the most original events in the gaming industry - the simultaneous release of five AAA class games by Valve within one set.</p>\n<p>The Orange Box is one “box” that was sold for the price of one full-fledged release of the AAA game, but included not one game, but five:</p>\n<p>Half-Life 2,<br />\nHalf-Life 2 Supplement: Episode One,<br />\nHalf-Life 2 Supplement: Episode Two,<br />\nPortal,<br />\nTeam fortress 2</p>\n<h3>The situation around the release of The Orange Box</h3>\n<p>The appearance of The Orange Box had several reasons. The development of three games at Valve went in parallel and ended almost simultaneously. At the same time, the games industry has matured to redefine the relationship between game manufacturers and game sellers. In particular, the sellers did not want to trade additions to games.</p>\n<h3>Valve Solution</h3>\n<p>By this time, Valve had already had problems distributing Half-Life 2: Episode One and decided to release Half-Life 2: Episode Two in the same set with other games for the price of one big release.</p>\n<p>As a result, not only Half-Life 2: Episode Two, but also games that were completely atypical for the market at that time: good multiplayer game Team Fortress 2 and a small indie game Portal, made good progress on the market.</p>\n<p>The release of The Orange Box also solved the main problem of the game Portal. This game was so different from everything in the world of games that the producers didn’t really know exactly how to explain to people what this game was good for.</p>\n<p>As part of the set, the game somehow fell into the hands of many people, they tried to play it, and later recognized its original features as its strengths and not its shortcomings. In particular, such a find as GLaDOS received great approval.</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2 and its predecessors</h3>\n<p>This game is a sequel to Half-Life, released six years after the first game.</p>\n<p>The first Half-Life has opened a new stage in the video game industry, especially in the shooter genre. Its innovations include:<br />\n- the development of the plot completely inside the playing space without using video,<br />\n- high artificial intelligence of opponents,<br />\n- the hero has allies,<br />\n- A new level of player interaction with the environment, as well as the constant need for such interaction for progress in the game. A lot of puzzles are also built on this interaction.</p>\n<p>The game is not divided into levels or missions. The player sees only through the eyes of the main character - Gordon Freeman. The hero can not be seen from the side, you can not hear his voice - this is done to fully immerse the player in the game.</p>\n<p>The arsenal of weapons in Half-Life is a combination of human (including powerful experimental) and alien weapons.</p>\n<p>In addition to 14 types of weapons that the hero can carry with him, occasionally there are stationary weapons, which can also be used. There are also grenades and booby traps.</p>\n<p>The action of the first half-life takes place in the underground Black Mesa Research Facility. They are experimenting with the so-called “Anomalous Material” - a crystal, the error in working with which opens a portal to another dimension, from which hostile aliens invade Earth.</p>\n<p>The hero, Gordon Freeman, worked as a researcher at this place, and after the disaster he tries to get out of the complex, penetrate the alien dimension and destroy the leader of a hostile alien civilization, Nihilanth, to close the portal and stop the alien invasion. In the final of the first game Gordon succeeds.</p>\n<p>There are three additions to the original Half-Life:<br />\n- Half-Life: Opposing Force (1999),<br />\n- Half-Life: Blue Shift (2001),<br />\n- Half-Life: Decay (2001).</p>\n<p>The events of the main plot and official additions occur simultaneously, as a result of which the paths of the characters can intersect, and the events can affect both the one addition and the others.</p>\n<p>Sometimes you have to play is not a character of Gordon, and you can see Gordon from the side.</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2</h3>\n<p>continues the story about twenty years after the incident at Black Mesa, in one of the largest cities on Earth, located somewhere in Eastern Europe - City 17.</p>\n<p>At the beginning of the game, Gordon Freeman finds himself on a train arriving in City 17, unarmed and without his protective suit. City 17 is ruled by a totalitarian government headed by Wallace Breen, former administrator of the Black Mesa research center. After the events of the first game, the power of aliens has been established all over the Earth - aliens rule through people who have passed to their side. Wallace Breen - the head of these traitors and the main agent of enemies.</p>\n<p>Half-Life 2 has become an even more noticeable breakthrough for the video game industry. The main technological advances of Half-Life 2 are:<br />\n- the new engine, which raised the level of character animation,<br />\n- even more powerful artificial intelligence of opponents,<br />\n- realistic physics of the game world,<br />\n- even more intense interaction of the player with the environment,</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2: Episode One</h3>\n<p>This is a continuation of the plot of Half-Life 2 and the first part of the trilogy of episodes - the sequels of Half-Life 2.</p>\n<p>For much of Episode One, the player interacts with the computer character Alyx Vance. The plot of the episode continues the story of Half-Life and Half-Life 2, and begins from the moment at which the previous game ended.</p>\n<p>Episode One is significantly shorter than Half-Life 2, all the action takes place in the City 17.</p>\n<h3>Half-Life 2: Episode Two</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>the second part in the trilogy of episodes, continuing the plot of the computer game Half-Life 2.  </li>\n</ul>\n<p>The creators of the game try to base each episode on a specific theme. As part of this strategy, Episode Two focuses on open spaces, long journeys (even by car) and less linear gameplay than in previous games in the Half-Life series. Locations include abandoned mines, ant-lion&#39;s nest and missile base.</p>\n<p>The game develops immediately after the events of Episode One in a wooded area near the destroyed City 17.</p>\n<p>Alyx Vance is present in the game, but less active than in the previous episode</p>\n<p>Each following addition is noticeably more perfect technically. This is part of the game manufacturer&#39;s strategy, which thus solved the problem of a gradual development of the game and the absence of long waiting periods for consumers.</p>\n<h3>Portal</h3>\n<p>The events of the game Portal take place in the Half-Life universe, in the Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center. The heroine is a girl named Chell.</p>\n<p>The gameplay is based on solving puzzles using a portable device Aperture Science Handheld Portal Device. This device allows you to create portals on flat surfaces through which you can instantly move yourself or objects in space.</p>\n<p>At the same time, only two portals can be opened, differing in color - blue and orange. When you open a new portal, the previously opened portal of the same color closes. In addition, portals of the same color can open on top of each other, while the portal “opposite” in color should be opened to the side.</p>\n<p>As the game progresses, tasks become more difficult, and to solve it is necessary to combine various techniques. Obstacles also arise: walls on which it is impossible to create a portal, energy fields. Passing through such fields destroys the items that the player carries, and also closes the open portals, leaving only the device for creating them.</p>\n<h3>GLaDOS</h3>\n<p>An essential part of the game is the GLaDOS, an artificial intelligence and self-awareness supercomputer that was developed for the Aperture Science Laboratories Computer-Aided Enrichment Center, but went out of control and captured the Enrichment Center.</p>\n<p>GLaDOS is an abbreviation for &quot;Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System&quot;. GLaDOS is a female character.</p>\n<p>In the game Portal GLaDOS is both the enemy of the player and his guide to the Enrichment Center. GLaDOS observes and controls the passage of tests, gives instructions on the use of objects of the Enrichment Center, sometimes gives advice and cautions. The voice of GLaDOS accompanies the player throughout the game, but until the very end it is unknown who or what GLaDOS is and what role it plays in Aperture Science.</p>\n<h3>Team fortress 2</h3>\n<p>Team Fortress was originally created as a modification for the Quake game. The success of this game led to the development of Team Fortress 2 - a game separate from Quake. The game with this name appeared after many years of work. The game had its own visual style and plot, full of hidden and explicit meanings. By genre, the game Team Fortress 2 is a multiplayer team shooter.</p>\n<h3>Plot</h3>\n<p>The world of Team Fortress 2 is the arena where the organizations RED and BLU, created by the Mann brothers, Blutarch and Redmond, secretly confront. The brothers competed for the land of the father.</p>\n<p>RED - short for Reliable Excavation &amp; Demolition. RED builds reservoirs, mines, produces bread and beer. The buildings of RED and its equipment are painted in red and yellow, the main building materials are wood, red brick and dark red metal sheets.</p>\n<p>BLU is short for Builders League United. The company builds hydroelectric power plants, owns dairy farms. Buildings BLU are made in blue and white colors of white brick and metal.</p>\n<p>RED and BLU are waging an irreconcilable struggle, which takes various forms - from unfair competition in business to armed clashes between specially hired mercenaries.</p>\n<p>Clashes take the form of seizing and holding control of territory, seizing important heights, destroying enemy bases and industrial espionage.</p>\n<p>Clashes between companies take place at various industrial sites, such as mines, reservoirs, quarries and power plants. The secret bases of corporations, computer centers and rocket bunkers under the guise of such organizations are often hidden.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>The game takes place on separate territories, called game maps. Each map refers to one of several game modes.</p>\n<p>Two teams take part in the game, which differ in the color of the form - Red and Blue - these are mercenaries of two opposing companies.</p>\n<p>Teams consist of characters that can be live players or bots. Each class of characters has weapons in their arsenal, allowing them to attack opponents from the other team, and other things designed for different purposes.</p>\n<h3>Game modes</h3>\n<p>Game mode defines the tasks of each team on the map.</p>\n<p>Capture The Flag<br />\nCapture the files<br />\nControl Points (in two versions: Symmetric Control Point and Attack / Defense)<br />\nTerritory control<br />\nPayload<br />\nArena<br />\nPayload race<br />\nKing of the hill<br />\nSpecial Delivery<br />\nMann vs. Machine<br />\nRobot Destroy<br />\nPass time</p>\n<p>The game has several classes of playing characters, quite different from each other.

The gameplay is almost similar to the original Half-Life’s: the storyline continues by navigating through the sequence of levels. Each level consists of both combat part and solving puzzles.

The game was inspired by the real-life Bosnian War.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>This War of Mine is set in a fictional country Graznavia during an ethnic conflict similar to the siege of Sarajevo. The player controls a group of one to four characters caught in the middle of a war. Each protagonist has a unique set of abilities and weaknesses, some of which are hidden. Their goal is to simply stay alive. It requires them to scavenge food, meds, and other necessary supplies, keep their house warm during the winter and avoid the military. </p>\n<p>By day, the city of Pogoren is filled with snipers who shoot at everyone indiscriminately. The player can explore the city only by night, though it is not safe either, as the characters can encounter hostile looters and marauders. Survival also requires crafting new items from the scavenged junk. One of the most useful items to build is the radio that allows the player to keep track of the events outside. To win the game, the characters have to survive until peacetime which may come at random times.</p>\n<h3>Expansion features</h3>\n<p>The Little Ones expansion pack allows the player to include a child in the group of survivors. It adds a new layer of complexity to the gameplay. The child is helpless and needs an adult to take care of him or her. However, the kid can eventually learn to perform simple tasks, such as cooking. To avoid depression, the child has to assemble new toys from the junk the adults have scavenged and meet other kids to play.</p>', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/fbd/fbd5d0e3dee011b5231ba162c3e32e07_rqfVJfP.jpg', '2016-01-29'),

The plot follows a fictionalized story of the Peloponnesian War between city-states of Sparta and Athens that left Greece devastated. The player can choose to control either a male (named Alexios) or female (named Kassandra) protagonist, both of them being descendants of the famous Spartan king Leonidas. The player enters the plot as a mercenary and can side with either Athens or its rival Sparta. There&#39;s also the frame story set in the contemporary age. Its protagonist is Layla Hassan, who was also the main character in the frame story of Assassin&#39;s Creed Origins.</p>\n<h3>Gameplay</h3>\n<p>Unlike most earlier installments of Assassin&#39;s Creed, which put the emphasis solely on action, Odyssey has a strong role-playing element in it. Dialogue options and the non-linear plot allow the player to reach several alternate endings. The game also has a reputation system and multiple options for romancing, including same-sex romances. The combat system is similar to that in Origins with the addition of new skills.

In the very beginning, the protagonist wakes up inside the Vault 101. His only aim is to find his father who left the warehouse some time ago. On his way, he will contact other survivors (both gangs and singles) and explore entire restoring areas of Washington D.C., Northern Virginia, and Maryland. The game offers countless progress opportunities, so the gameplay is overloaded with various features including types of customization, numerous conversations with NPC’s, side quests – everything that an average player is going to face.</p>', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5a4/5a4e70bb8a862829dbaa398aa5f66afc.jpg', 'a:7:{i:0;s:74:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/5a4/5a4e70bb8a862829dbaa398aa5f66afc.jpg\";i:1;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1b3/1b3fab64387cde5bbd7b86e4b61da724.jpg\";i:2;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/f23/f2322edfcc771f893db5d7a295c8bdb5.jpg\";i:3;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/deb/debd5072caa03ec4c3450d6b05858ab5.jpg\";i:4;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/82d/82d0e2edcb5ac3aa076cf7fd9bbb55cd.jpg\";i:5;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/41f/41f7849d528073b738643cf7dad1c549.jpg\";i:6;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/657/657d84a9149a27ffe7e194fa1767a22b.jpg\";}', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/stories-640/c18/c18d31fec2f17f4c01725be24e2f3e04.mp4', '2008-10-28', 'a:3:{i:0;s:2:\"PC\";i:1;s:11:\"PlayStation\";i:2;s:4:\"Xbox\";}', 'Minimum:                    \nOperating system: Windows XP/Vista                    \nProcessor: 2.4 Ghz Intel Pentium 4 or equivalent processor                     \nMemory: 1 GB (XP)/ 2 GB (Vista)                    \nHard disk space: 7 GB                    \nVideo: Direct X 9.0c compliant video card with 256MB RAM (NVIDIA 6800 or better/ATI X850 or better)                     \nSound: DirectX®: 9.0c                    \nController support:  Xbox 360 controller                    \nOther Requirements: Online play requires log-in to Games For Windows - Live                    Supported Video Card Chipsets:                     \nNVIDIA GeForce 200 series, Geforce 9800 series, Geforce 9600 series, Geforce 8800 series, Geforce 8600 series, Geforce 8500 series, Geforce 8400 series, Geforce 7900 series, Geforce 7800 series, Geforce 7600 series, Geforce 7300 series, GeForce 6800 series                    \nATI HD 4800 series, HD 4600 series, HD 3800 series, HD 3600 series, HD 3400 series, HD 2900 series, HD 2600 series, HD 2400 series, X1900 series, X1800 series, X1600 series, X1300 series, X850 series                    ', 'Recommended:                    \nOperating system: Windows XP/Vista                    \nProcessor: Intel Core 2 Duo processor                     \nMemory: 2 GB System RAM                     \nHard disk space: 7 GB                    \nVideo: Direct X 9.0c compliant video card with 512MB RAM (NVIDIA 8800 series, ATI 3800 series)                     \nSound: DirectX®: 9.0c                    \nController support:  Xbox 360 controller                    ', 'a:2:{i:0;s:7:\"Shooter\";i:1;s:3:\"RPG\";}', 'Bethesda Softworks', 91),

(571, 'Resident Evil 4', '<p>Resident Evil 4 is a third-person shooter game developed by Capcom Production Studio 4 and published by Capcom. The sixth major installment in the Resident Evil series, it was originally released for the GameCube in 2005. Players control U.S. government special agent Leon S. Kennedy, who is sent on a mission to rescue the U.S. president&#39;s daughter Ashley Graham, who has been kidnapped by a cult. In a rural part of Europe, Leon fights hordes of villagers infected by a mind-controlling parasite, and reunites with the spy Ada Wong.<br />\nDevelopment began for PlayStation 2 in 1999. Four proposed versions were discarded; the first attempt was directed by Hideki Kamiya after producer Shinji Mikami. In a departure from the fixed camera angles and slower survival horror gameplay of previous instalments, the team focused on developing more dynamic shooting action.<br />\nResident Evil 4 was announced as a GameCube exclusive as part of the Capcom Five, but was ported to numerous formats, becoming a cross-platform hit, selling over 10 million copies across all platforms. It garnered acclaim for its narrative, gameplay, voice acting, and characters, and is often named one of the best video games, winning multiple Game of the Year awards in 2005. It influenced the evolution of the survival horror and third-person genres, popularizing the &quot;over-the-shoulder&quot; third-person view. Resident Evil 5 was released in 2009.</p>\n<h1>Gameplay</h1>\n<p>The player controls the protagonist, Leon S. Kennedy, from a third-person perspective. Departing significantly from the series&#39; previous games, the gameplay focuses on action and shootouts with fewer survival horror elements. The camera is placed behind Leon and zooms in for an over-the-shoulder view when aiming a weapon, or a first-person view when aiming with a sniper rifle. There is no crosshair for firearms; instead, every firearm has a laser sight. Unlike previous games where players can only shoot straight, up, or down, players have more options. For example, shots to the feet can cause enemies to stumble, and shots to the arms can make them drop their weapons. Players can also shoot down projectiles like thrown axes or scythes.<br />\nResident Evil 4 adds context-sensitive controls. Based on the situation, players can interact with the environment: kicking down a ladder, jumping out of a window, dodging an attack or executing a &quot;finishing move&quot; on weakened enemies. There are also quick time events, in which the player must press buttons indicated on-screen to execute actions such as dodging a falling boulder or wrestling an enemy to stay alive. These are often incorporated into the game&#39;s many boss fights, in which the player must avoid instant-kill attacks.<br />\nThe main enemies are violent villagers referred to as Los Ganados (&quot;The Cattle&quot; in Spanish). Los Ganados can dodge, wield melee and projectile weapons, and are capable of working collectively and communicating with each other.<br />\nThe inventory system features a grid system, represented by an attaché case, that has each item take up a certain number of spaces. The case can be upgraded several times, allowing for more space. Weapons, ammunition, and healing items are kept in the case, while key items and treasures are kept in a separate menu. Items may be bought from and sold to a merchant that appears in various locations. He sells first aid sprays, weapons, allows for weapons to be upgraded and buys various treasures that Leon finds. The various weapons each have their own advantages and disadvantages.<br />\nCapcom added content for the PlayStation 2 version, which was later incorporated into the PC and Wii releases. The largest addition is &quot;Separate Ways&quot;, a minigame which focuses on Ada Wong&#39;s involvement in Resident Evil 4 and her connection to the series&#39; villain Albert Wesker. &quot;Ada&#39;s Report&quot;, a five-part documentary, analyzes Ada&#39;s relationship with Wesker and his role in the plot. Other unlockable content in all versions includes the minigames &quot;The Mercenaries&quot; and &quot;Assignment Ada&quot; (using Ada to retrieve Las Plagas samples), new costumes for Leon and Ashley, new weapons, and a cutscene browser.</p>\n<h1>Plot</h1>\n<p>U.S. government agent Leon S. Kennedy (Paul Mercier) is on a mission to rescue Ashley Graham (Carolyn Lawrence), the U.S. President&#39;s daughter, who has been kidnapped by a mysterious cult. He travels to a nameless rural village in Spain, where he encounters a group of hostile villagers who pledge their lives to Los Illuminados, the cult that kidnapped Ashley. The villagers were once simple farmers until becoming infected by a mind-controlling parasite known as Las Plagas.<br />\nWhile in the village, Leon is captured by its chief, Bitores Mendez, and injected with Las Plagas. He finds himself held captive with Luis Sera (Rino Romano), a former Los Illuminados researcher. The two work together to escape, but soon go their separate ways. Leon finds out Ashley is being held in a church and rescues her. They both escape from the church after Osmund Saddler (Michael Gough), leader of Los Illuminados, reveals his plan to use the plaga they injected into Ashley to manipulate her into injecting the president of the United States with a &quot;sample&quot; once she returns home, allowing Saddler to begin his conquest of the world.<br />\nAfter killing Mendez, Leon and Ashley try to take refuge in a castle but are attacked by more Illuminados under the command of Ramon Salazar (Rene Mujica), another of Saddler&#39;s henchmen who owns the castle, and the two become separated by Salazar&#39;s traps. Meanwhile, Luis searches for pills that will slow Leon and Ashley&#39;s infection, as well as a sample of Las Plagas. He brings the two items to Leon but is killed by Saddler, who takes the sample, while the pills to suppress the infection remain in Leon&#39;s hands. While in the castle, Leon briefly encounters Ada Wong (Sally Cahill), a woman from his past who supports him during his mission. He battles his way through the castle before killing Salazar.<br />\nAfterward, Leon travels to a nearby island research facility, where he continues the search for Ashley. He discovers that one of his former training comrades, Jack Krauser (Jim Ward), who was believed to have been killed in a helicopter crash two years prior, is responsible for her kidnapping. Ada and Krauser are working with Albert Wesker (Richard Waugh), for whom both intend to secure a Plagas sample. Suspicious of the mercenary&#39;s intentions, Saddler orders Krauser to kill Leon, believing that no matter which one dies, he will benefit. After Krauser&#39;s fatal defeat, Leon rescues Ashley, and they remove the Plagas from their bodies using a specialized radiotherapeutic device. Leon confronts Saddler, and with Ada&#39;s help, manages to kill him. However, Ada takes the sample from Leon at gunpoint before escaping in a helicopter, leaving Leon and Ashley to escape via her jet-ski as the island explodes.</p>', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fee/fee0100afd87b52bfbd33e26689fa26c.jpg', 'a:7:{i:0;s:74:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/fee/fee0100afd87b52bfbd33e26689fa26c.jpg\";i:1;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/d26/d26bbb090817a799df765d2fd4e90d33.jpg\";i:2;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/af5/af57e087289820d3d77fa5538b3a33d7.jpg\";i:3;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/83e/83e7f1f0b4c9b8666348d703f905bda8.jpg\";i:4;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/b11/b119cb469f2dac1a6cde79b6db6cd1a7.jpg\";i:5;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/258/2584d15b9bcff1c715deb8b51919672a.jpg\";i:6;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/adb/adbe6b1841ca2509fc9ac04e063d3a65.jpg\";}', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/stories-640/a3f/a3fad546a4aa8d051072a1994222f15b.mp4', '2005-01-11', 'a:6:{i:0;s:2:\"PC\";i:1;s:11:\"PlayStation\";i:2;s:4:\"Xbox\";i:3;s:3:\"iOS\";i:4;s:7:\"Android\";i:5;s:8:\"Nintendo\";}', 'PC Minimum: Not specified', 'PC Recommended: Not specified', 'a:3:{i:0;s:6:\"Action\";i:1;s:7:\"Shooter\";i:2;s:9:\"Adventure\";}', 'Ubisoft Entertainment', 83),

Unlike many survival games, Subnautica has a detailed plot, in which Ryley has to uncover why his ship crashed. By exploring the ocean, finding the remnants of other crashes, and listening to the radio messages, Robinson will learn about the enormous Leviathan, the mysterious Precursors, and the reason why this planet is quarantined.<br />\nThe game is famous for its spectacular portrayal of the ocean and its wildlife. Robinson is equipped with a scuba diving gear that allows the player to spend most of the game underwater, although oxygen still has to be replenished.

The latter is still wanted by hardcore fans, which gave the publisher Activision Blizzard a reason to remaster the game.</p>\n<h3>Key features</h3>\n<p>In the new version, developers from the Raven Software did their best to rebuild the experience (the original game was developed by Infinity Ward). The game is available for purchase, as a separate product, and as part of a bundle. Owners of the original version of the game can get Remastered for free - you need to have the original disk for this or digital purchase. The re-released game did not change the gameplay in any way: it is still a fast-paced first-person shooter. The story campaign, during which the player takes control of several characters, also has not changed. Most of the changes turned out to be cosmetic and allowed the new studio to add new technologies to the original game: for example, while prone and moving, the weapon touching the ground will vibrate the controller.

Thus, he has to move across Seattle to reach his final destination.

Players can use Randall’s ability to entrap zombies by luring them into environmental hazards, and other mechanics of running, creeping and climbing obstacles to bypass enemies.

Roles are not fixed and can change during the playthrough.</p>', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/games/473/473bd9a5e9522629d6cb28b701fb836a.jpg', 'a:7:{i:0;s:74:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/games/473/473bd9a5e9522629d6cb28b701fb836a.jpg\";i:1;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/9ab/9abb12bf62c4bca53f5d098cee0191bd.jpg\";i:2;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/25d/25dec72d35336440318a3cfe5f536ca0.jpg\";i:3;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/6ce/6cefb68df2a6932c4a0ce3eddc77acd6.jpg\";i:4;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/aba/abaaa72ee767ff57d87a3ba89ed00973.jpg\";i:5;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/1ec/1ec3f2701e9e171fe19f214d1194b56e.jpg\";i:6;s:80:\"https://media.rawg.io/media/screenshots/863/863bf8e020518c796d7768745e62a5ef.jpg\";}', 'https://media.rawg.io/media/stories-640/28e/28e5af04a0a66cb3b2ccc5cab2abaf09.mp4', '2018-03-23', 'a:3:{i:0;s:2:\"PC\";i:1;s:11:\"PlayStation\";i:2;s:4:\"Xbox\";}', 'Minimum:\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\nOS: Windows 7 64-bit, 8.1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit\nProcessor: Intel core i3-2100T @ 2.5GHz/AMD FX 6100, or better\nMemory: 8 GB RAM\nGraphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 650Ti 2GB, AMD Radeon HD 7750 2GB\nStorage: 25 GB available space', 'Recommended:\nRequires a 64-bit processor and operating system\nOS: Windows 7 64-bit, 8.1 64-bit or Windows 10 64-bit\nProcessor: Intel Core i5 3570K; AMD Ryzen 3 1300x or equivalent\nMemory: 16 GB RAM\nGraphics: Nvidia GTX 960; AMD R9 290 or equivalent\nStorage: 25 GB available space', 'a:3:{i:0;s:6:\"Action\";i:1;s:9:\"Adventure\";i:2;s:5:\"Indie\";}', 'Electronic Arts', 78),
